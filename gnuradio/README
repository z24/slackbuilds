GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that
provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can
be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create
software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like
environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial
environments to support both wireless communications research and
real-world radio systems.
