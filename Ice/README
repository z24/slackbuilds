Internet Communications Engine, or Ice, is a Remote Procedure Call and
object middleware system developed by ZeroC (http://www.zeroc.com/)
and dual-licensed under the GNU GPL and a proprietary license.  It
aims to be useful for real-world systems without being overly complex,
and also being highly efficient and scalable. It's supported on a very
large number of environments, including C++, Java, .NET, Visual Basic,
Python, Ruby and PHP.

Ice requires the mcpp package (also available at SlackBuilds.org).
